I got my first computer, [Didaktik M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didaktik), when I was 9. And since I learned how to use the built in BASIC programming language, I wanted to make my own games. I remember my greatest achievement was a square map editor for a [Czech D&D clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dra%C4%8D%C3%AD_doup%C4%9B). 
 
Later at high school I made my first platformer called _Alois the Digger_ in Pascal for PC, a clone of [Manic Miner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner). The graphics were simple, it was a text game with all sprites created as a font. 
 
I also studied computer graphics because I wanted to join the game industry.
